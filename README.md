### reflection 

####  thoughts on this project:
At first I couldn't figure out how to combine things from previous project to make this one . It was a major challenge like the edit button. How did i go about  it you ask??? Well since you want to know so badly , I had a thought , what if i edit the array that i pushed it to and just replace it there. I do not have to re save and all that and the post will update the information. I do wish however how to structure it inside a button or choice !
